Preface
-------

In this section, we discuss how to get started with your first trading strategy on decentralised exchanges.
Capitalgram is a Python library that integrates with any :term:`Jupyter Notebook` installation.

The easiest way to use Capitalgram is to use a hosted :term:`notebook` on `Google Colab <https://research.google.com/colaboratory/>`_.

Running on Google Colab
-----------------------

1. Create a free Google account

2. Pick one of the :ref:`examples` and click *Open in Colab* badge.

Advanced usage
------------------

The free Google Colab accounts are resource constrained.
Please see :ref:`Installation` to use Capitalgram with local Python installation, Jupyter Notebook or similar environment where you can do more heavy lifting work.

You want to do this when

* You need to do heavy analysis that consumes several gigabytes of RAM, like when analysing data with one minute :term:`candle` accuracy

* You want to have your backtests run faster

* You are doing specialised analysis, like one based on machine learning techniques
