Trading Strategy is a protocol for :term:`on-chain` quantitative finance and trade automation. You can develop and :term:`backtest` trading strategies based on all trades ever happened on any blockchain. Live `data <https://mightyeagle.capitalgram.com/datasets>`_ is available to one minute accuracy.

The ready strategies, or trading bots, can be deployed as :term:`autonomous agents <autonomous agent>` running on :term:`smart contracts <smart contract>`. Strategies then trade on :term:`decentralised exchanges <decentralised exchange>`. After deployed, anyone can invest in and withdraw from the strategies in real time. As trade rules are automated on-chain, anyone can verify the honest execution of the trading strategy.

Trading Strategy integrates with :term:`Jupyter notebook`, :term:`Pandas`, :term:`Backtrader` and other popular quantitative finance toolkits popular in `Python data science ecosystem <http://python.org/>`_.
